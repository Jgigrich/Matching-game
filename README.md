# Matching Game

Find the matching cards in the fewest moves.

A practice game for the Udacity FEND nano degree.

## How To Play :octocat:

##### Default game
Click any card to flip it over and reveal its icon. Click a second card to flip it over. If the two cards match they stay open, and if not they flip back over.

Did you memorize those first cards?  As you see more cards try to remember their positions so finding their match is easier.

After you find all the matching cards your elapsed time stops and your stats are displayed. Try to use the fewest moves to get a higher star rating.

##### Variations
Click on the "settings" button to open the settings menu. Here you can adjust the number of cards needed for a match.

The game play is the same as the two card version, only now you select more than two cards before seeing if they match.

As always, if you want a high star rating use very few moves to find all the matches.
